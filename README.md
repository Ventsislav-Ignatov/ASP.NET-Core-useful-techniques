## 👉 Project Introduction 👈
A simple project that introduces techniques that can be very useful for coding which is repetitive, for abstraction and etc.

## 📝 Project Description
###### 
### 1. Global Exception Handler which is Middleware for abstraction and sure way that every exception which is throw and is not catch is catch from the middleware. Better security and less code.
### 2. Global Service Registration in ASP.NET Core Dependency Container. Just need to inheritance the right interface(IScopedService, IService or ISingleton) in your interface for bussines logic.
### 3. The Repository and Unit of Work Patterns
The repository and unit of work patterns are intended to create an abstraction layer between the data access layer and the business logic layer of an application. Implementing these patterns can help insulate your application from changes in the data store and can facilitate automated unit testing or test-driven development (TDD).
